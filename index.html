                <div class="project-info">
                    <p>AirMo is my latest creation: a wireless, gesture-based, wearable computer mouse designed to revolutionize the way we interact with computers. 
                        Traditional computer mice are medically proven to strain your wrists over time. AirMo offers an innovative solution by utilizing an accelerometer 
                        and gyroscope to track hand movements, seamlessly translating them into mouse cursor control.</p>

                     <p>Equipped with two triggers on its underside, AirMo enables essential functionalities like right-clicking, left-clicking, and even gesture-based scrolling. 
                        It is fully capable of performing everything a traditional mouse can do, but what sets AirMo apart is its reprogrammable nature. You can customize it to 
                        execute tasks such as adjusting volume, copying, cutting, pasting, or any other action you need, all through gestures and button combinations.</p>

                    <p>As a wireless device, AirMo provides unparalleled freedom of movement, allowing you to interact with your computer from virtually anywhere within range.</p> 

                    <p>Currently in its first prototype phase, AirMo is an ongoing project 
                        I'm actively developing throughout the semester. I'm planning to implement many new features and improvements in 
                        future versions to enhance its functionality and user experience. Stay tuned for updates as I continue to push the boundaries of wearable technology with AirMo!</p>

            <div class="project-content">
                <img src="pics/makewucpic.jpg" alt="Assistive Web Navigation Device">
                <div class="project-info">
                    <p>This project was created to empower differently-abled individuals to browse the internet and navigate their computers without relying on traditional keyboards and mice. 
                        It addresses challenges faced by individuals who may have a missing hand, fingers, or arm, offering a fully customizable solution tailored to their specific needs.</p>
                    <p>In its current prototype, the device is designed for individuals without hands. It allows users to control the mouse cursor using head movements while enabling 
                        additional functionalities like clicking, starting voice typing, and accessing keyboard capabilities. 
                        These are achieved through touch sensor buttons integrated into a wearable vestâ€”in this case, a modified t-shirt.</p>
                    <p>This wired system aims to provide seamless and intuitive computer interaction for users with diverse abilities. 
                        Since this project was made during a hackathon, the prototype looks rushed and messy, but it laid the groundwork for further exploration and development.</p>

            <div class="project-content">
                <img src="pics/autoroomlightpic.jpg" alt="Auto room lights">
                <div class="project-info">
                    <p>This project was inspired by my dad's frustration with my habit of forgetting to turn off the lights when leaving my room. 
                        While exploring options for an automatic light switcher, I noticed a significant flaw in common motion-detected lights: they turn off even if someone is
                         still in the room but not moving. To solve this issue, I designed a more reliable system.</p>
                    <p>The device is positioned at the room's entrance and connects to the lights via a relay. It detects and counts people entering and leaving the room using high-precision, 
                        long-distance IR sensors. When someone enters the room, the lights automatically turn on and remain on until the person leaves. This ensures that the lights
                         won't turn off unexpectedly while someone is still inside. Additionally, I incorporated a manual override option, 
                         allowing the lights to be controlled wirelessly through an app for added convenience.</p>
                    <p>This solution eliminates unnecessary energy usage without the drawbacks of traditional motion-activated systems, offering a smarter and more user-friendly approach to light automation.</p>

                <div class="project-info">
                    <p>I love playing video games on my computer, but the traditional keyboard and mouse setup has never been my favorite. 
                        While I'm a huge fan of the immersive experience that VR gaming offers, I didn't have the budget for a VR 
                        headset or setup. So, I decided to create a similar experience on my desktop by modifying a Nerf gun to play 
                        first-person shooter games like CS:GO and Valorant. This setup provides an immersive experience on PC without the need for VR goggles.</p>

                    <p>To achieve this, I used an accelerometer and gyroscope to track the movements of the gun and control the in-game model accordingly.
                         I also attached a joystick and a few buttons to the barrel of the gun, allowing me to handle and control movement and other in-game actions seamlessly.</p>
